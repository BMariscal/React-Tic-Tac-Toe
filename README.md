# React-Tic-Tac-Toe

  * Future Plans:
      * Break down the Game.js component into a container component and a presentational component(it's currently doing too much)
      * Remove repetition of this.arr (follow the DRY principle). 
      
      * Allow the player to choose between X or O.
      * Allow player to play with computer.
